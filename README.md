# DayTracker
A mini application that tracks the current event that happens at a given time in the day, and executes a set of actions on the current event.

The application maintains a system clock (representing the time of a day), then loads from a file the actions that must be executed. 

Status - Completed 
(Might edit and add more functionality later)
